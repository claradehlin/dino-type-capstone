    "Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that have lived on Earth for about 245 million years. ",
    "In 1842, the English naturalist Sir Richard Owen coined the term Dinosauria, derived from the Greek deinos, meaning 'fearfully great,' and sauros, meaning 'lizard.'",
    "Dinosaur fossils have been found on all seven continents.",
    "All non-avian dinosaurs went extinct about 66 million years ago.",
    "There are roughly 700 known species of extinct dinosaurs.",
    "Modern birds are a kind of dinosaur because they share a common ancestor with non-avian dinosaurs.",
    "In most cases, a fossilized bone is actually a rock made out of minerals, with no trace of the original bone material.",
    "There are several theories as to what may have contributed to the mass extinction of non-avian dinosaurs and other species at the end of the Cretaceous Period. It is certain that a massive asteroid or comet struck Earth during this time, causing a dramatic shift in Earth's climate. Some scientists speculate that this impact had catastrophic consequences for life on Earth. But other factors, including changing sea levels and large-scale volcanic activity, may also have played a significant role in this mass extinction.",
    "From an individual footprint, scientists can estimate the height of the dinosaur that made it. A rough estimate of leg length is obtained by multiplying the print length by four.",
    "One of the most intelligent dinosaurs was Troodon. It was a hunting dinosaur, about 2 metres long, and had a brain size similar to that of a mammal or bird of today, stereoscopic vision, and grasping hands.",
    "The dinosaur with the longest name was Micropachycephalosaurus meaning 'tiny thick-headed lizard'. Its fossils have been found in China, and it was named in 1978 by the Chinese paleontologist Dong."
